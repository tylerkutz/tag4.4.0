FOR FUN README
--------------


This example imports some atlas experiment components from CAD.


Detector Attributes
-------------------

The cad model attributes are set in cad.gxml. This filename is what gemc will look for when importing cad solids.
Notice that the HEC is set sensitive, so it will actually record and digitize hits.


To Run
------

execute:

gemc atlas.gcard
