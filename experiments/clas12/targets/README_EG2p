--------------------------------------------------

There are five variations of the EG2p nuclear targets assembly: "12C", "27Al", "63Cu", "118Sn", "208Pb". They are all set in "targets.pl"

To switch from a nuclear target to an other just change the variation in the gcard, as mentioned in EG2p/eg2p.gcard:

<!-- Nuclear Target Assembly EG2p; variation can be 12C, 27Al, 63Cu, 118Sn, 208Pb -->
	<detector name="target" factory="TEXT" variation="63Cu"/>
	<detector name="EG2p/" factory="CAD"/>

The properties of these nuclear target foils are defined in "geometry.pl", however, the CAD files are common for all nuclei and reside under "EG2p" dir.

Before running "gemc" remember to run the command to build the required geometry and materials text files:

./targets.pl config.dat
