FOR FUN README
--------------


This example shows how to import models from several sources and assign color, sensitivity to a CAD import.

It contains the mighty starship enterprise (NCC 1701-A, TOS), imported straight from CAD.

It contain a truck and a dragon, also from CAD.

There sphere in GDML format.


Detector Attributes
-------------------

The cad model attributes are set in cad.gxml. This filename is what gemc will look for when importing cad solids.
Notice that the dragon is set sensitive, so it will actually record and digitize hits.

Any gdml model's attributes can be set in its corresponding gxml file. In this example in sphere.gxml we set the
sphere to be made of lead, and pink.



To Run
------

execute:

gemc forFun.gcard


For fun, put a number between "10" and "50" on the number of events and click "Run" to have the enterprise
shoot a beam of protons!
